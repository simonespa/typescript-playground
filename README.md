# Typescript Playground

Vanilla setup of a Typescript project with Jest testing framework.

This project setup a minimal Typescript and Jest configuration to get started coding and testing in a Node.js environment.

I used this playground during the "TypeScript intermediate" BBC Academy course, adding exercises and code samples practiced during the training.

## How to use it

Install all dependencies

```
npm install
```

To play around with the code and create your own stuff, run TS in watch mode in order to get incremental compilation errors while you code

```
npm run dev
```

You can build your code with

```
npm run build
```

Or execute a TypeScript module directly with `ts-node`

```
npm start <path/to/the/file.ts>
```

You can also write tests and run the entire suite once

```
npm run test
```

or run it in watch mode

```
npm run test:watch
```
